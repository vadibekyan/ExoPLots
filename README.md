# ExoPLots

Several codes (**mass_year**, ) to visualize exoplanet data extracted from the NASA Exoplanet Archive

## Usage

**mass_year** has two potentially useful functions.

``planet_discovery_stat()``  displays the number of discovered planets by different methods:


```python
planet_discovery_stat()

-----  Some Stats -----
5463 planets discovered so far

1088 via Transiting/TTV methods
1043 via RV method
200 via Microlensing method
64 via Imaging method
35 by other methods
-----     End     ----
```
``mass_vs_year_plot()``  plots the mass of the discovered planets as a function of the year of their discovery.
